# esxicollector
The scripts that collect data from VMware ESXi system through SNMP protocol and output data as open-falcon json format

# Why use esxicollector?

You have a dedicated server with VMware ESXi operating system and you want to monitor the snmp information through open-falcon. 
Then you will need some scripts that can translate the snmp OIDs information into certain metric in json-format. 

# How to use it?

  1. Install SNMP command.  
     ```yum -y install net-snmp net-snmp-utils```
  2. Download VMware ESXi MIB files and copy all the mibs files to directory like ```/usr/share/snmp/mibs```
  3. Setup SNMP config  
     ```mkdir ~/.snmp```  
     ```echo "mibs +ALL" > ~/.snmp/snmp.conf ```
  4. Fill proper content into the variables in `exsi_collector.sh`
  5. Setup cronjobs  
     ``` * * * * * exsi_collector.sh ```	


# How to verify?

The ```snmp_queries.sh``` script calls the basic snmp command and makes plain output. You can compare the json result generated by ```60_esxi_*.sh``` with the plain output.
